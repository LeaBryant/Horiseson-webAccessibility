# Description

In this repository for this Challenge it was to make sure that the webpage meets the meets accessibility standards. 


    I found that the code didnt have a clear flow to it.
    Then went in to the semantic HTML elements and noticed there were many different layers but that the footer could be combined on the CSS style sheet to help with the look of the web page. I did find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, except for the side blog piece, to help with easy navagting through the page I added <aside> to the stucture so that it can clear state on where on the page it is. But I noticed that When you clicking on "Search engine Op" test in the header/nav it did not take you to the blog spot like the others. So that was fix by correcting the HTML code in the header by add in the correct # loction. Also with the images that there was not alt attributes after the images. So I did go ahead and Added alt attributes descriptive text to the images.
